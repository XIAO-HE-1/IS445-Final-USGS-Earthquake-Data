### USGS Earthquake Dataset
<img src="https://github.com/XIAO-HE-1/IS445-Final-USGS-Earthquake-Data/blob/main/usgs_picture.png" width="800">  

* Our data is retrieved from the [US Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes). 
* In our visualization report, we used both [historical data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/) and [real-time data in the last hour](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_hour.geojson)
* The dataset includes time, location information(latitude,longitude, place), earthquake information(magnitude, earthquake type), measurement error(horizontal Error, depth Error) etc.  

### Goal of Project 
* Provide a dashboard that shows audience the earthquakes in the last hour and the last seven days
* Easy access to various earthquake information
* Know the location and the magnitude of the earthquakes

### Structure of our project
* Data Exploration
  * Descriptive statistics
    * Magnitude frequency
    * Earthquake count by date/region
    * Magtype, location sourceâ€¦.
  * Geographical display
* Real-time Data Dashboard
* Summary of any stumbling blocks we might have had
